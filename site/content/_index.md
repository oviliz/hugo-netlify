      If you have a website for your church or ministry, you would likely be
      paying a secular hosting company to look after you. We would love taking
      you on board!

  heading: Our values
  text: >-
    We are Bible-believing Christians. We do also believe that Jesus is the Son
    of God (e.g. John 9:35-38) and God (e.g. Colossians 1:11-16) and is by faith
    in Him alone that we are justified. We want to help ministries that are
    Jesus centred and preaching salvation by faith alone in the Son of God.
