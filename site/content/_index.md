    Hosting for Jesus is the ultimate spot for coffee lovers who want to learn
    about their java’s origin and support the farmers that grew it. We take
    coffee production, roasting and brewing seriously and we’re glad to pass
    that knowledge to anyone.

      We sell green and roasted coffee beans that are sourced directly from
      independent farmers and farm cooperatives. We’re proud to offer a variety
      of coffee beans grown with great care for the environment and local
      communities. Check our post or contact us directly for current
      availability.

      We offer a small, but carefully curated selection of brewing gear and
      tools for every taste and experience level. No matter if you roast your
      own beans or just bought your first french press, you’ll find a gadget to
      fall in love with in our shop.

    Coffee is an amazing part of human culture but it has a dark side too – one
    of colonialism and mindless abuse of natural resources and human lives. We
    want to turn this around and return the coffee trade to the drink’s
    exhilarating, empowering and unifying nature.
