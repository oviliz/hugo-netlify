      We are Bible-believing Christians. We do also believe that Jesus is the
      Son of God (e.g. John 9:35-38) and God (e.g. Colossians 1:11-16) and is by
      faith in him alone that we are justified.

      1 Corinthians 15:1-4


      We want to help ministries that are Jesus centred and preaching salvation
      by faith alone in the Son of God.

      Sorry, but we can't host everybody and Galatians 5:4 should give you a
      hint (and hopefully a thought): "Christ is become of no effect unto you,
      whosoever of you are justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace."
      Also, Ephesians 2:8-9 states: "For by grace are ye saved through faith;
      and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any
      man should boast."

      If you don't understand, please get in touch and will try to do better.
