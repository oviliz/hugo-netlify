      We are Bible-believing Christians. We do also believe that Jesus is the
      Son of God (e.g. John 9:35-38) and God (e.g. Colossians 1:11-16) and is by
      faith in him alone that we are justified.

      1 Corinthians 15:1-4


      We want to help ministries that are Jesus centred and preaching salvation
      by faith alone in the Son of God.

      Single-origin coffee is coffee grown within a single known geographic
      origin. Sometimes, this is a single farm or a specific collection of beans
      from a single country. The name of the coffee is then usually the place it
      was grown to whatever degree available.
  - heading: Sustainable farming

      Sustainable agriculture is farming in sustainable ways based on an
      understanding of ecosystem services, the study of relationships between
      organisms and their environment. What grows where and how it is grown are
      a matter of choice and careful consideration for nature and communities.
  - heading: Direct sourcing

      We want to truly empower the communities that bring amazing coffee to you.
      Thatâ€™s why we reinvest 20% of our profits into farms, local businesses and
      schools everywhere our coffee is grown. You can see the communities grow
      and learn more about coffee farming on our blog.
  - heading: We don't host everybody

      Sorry, but we can't host everybody and Galatians 5:4 should give you a
      hint (and hopefully a thought): "Christ is become of no effect unto you,
      whosoever of you are justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace."
      Also, Ephesians 2:8-9 states: "For by grace are ye saved through faith;
      and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any
      man should boast."

      If you don't understand, please get in touch and will try to do better.
