      Coffee is a small tree or shrub that grows in the forest understory in its
      wild form, and traditionally was grown commercially under other trees that
      provided shade. The forest-like structure of shade coffee farms provides
      habitat for a great number of migratory and resident species.

      Single-origin coffee is coffee grown within a single known geographic
      origin. Sometimes, this is a single farm or a specific collection of beans
      from a single country. The name of the coffee is then usually the place it
      was grown to whatever degree available.
  - heading: Sustainable farming

      Sustainable agriculture is farming in sustainable ways based on an
      understanding of ecosystem services, the study of relationships between
      organisms and their environment. What grows where and how it is grown are
      a matter of choice and careful consideration for nature and communities.

      We want to truly empower the communities that bring amazing coffee to you.
      Thatâ€™s why we reinvest 20% of our profits into farms, local businesses and
      schools everywhere our coffee is grown. You can see the communities grow
      and learn more about coffee farming on our blog.

      Sorry, but we can't host everybody and Galatians 5:4 should give you a
      hint (and hopefully a thought): "Christ is become of no effect unto you,
      whosoever of you are justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace."
      Also, Ephesians 2:8-9 states: "For by grace are ye saved through faith;
      and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any
      man should boast."

      If you don't understand, please get in touch.
