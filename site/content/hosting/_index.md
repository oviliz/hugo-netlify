  First of all, honesty. We are not a classic hosting business aiming at revenue
  at any cost, reviewing yearly turnover and setting a new higher target.

        No technicalities. Most of the Christians behind a ministry we know,
        don't have time nor experience to manage their hosting appropriately. We
        like to simplify and minimise things so you have more time for your
        ministry.

        We are meticulous with security and there's never enough. We go as far
        as applying security patches to your website if we find out is needed.
        Rest assured that we advise you about it anyway and there's no
        additional cost.

        Although the servers require restarting from time to time due to needed
        maintenance, we stand by at least 99.9% uptime in any case, which is an
        industry-standard.

        As above, we go beyond what a classic hosting company would limit
        themselves to. If we can work together to improve your website, we're
        more than happy to help. We try to abide by Colossians 3:23.

    If you have a website for your church or ministry, you would likely be
    paying a secular hosting company to look after you. We would love taking you
    on board!
