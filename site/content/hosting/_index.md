  Hosting for Jesus is the ultimate spot for coffee lovers who want to learn
  about their java’s origin and support the farmers that grew it. We take coffee
  production, roasting and brewing seriously and we’re glad to pass that
  knowledge to anyone.

        We sell green and roasted coffee beans that are sourced directly from
        independent farmers and farm cooperatives. We’re proud to offer a
        variety of coffee beans grown with great care for the environment and
        local communities. Check our post or contact us directly for current
        availability.

        We offer a small, but carefully curated selection of brewing gear and
        tools for every taste and experience level. No matter if you roast your
        own beans or just bought your first french press, you’ll find a gadget
        to fall in love with in our shop.

    First of all, honesty. We are not a classic hosting business looking aiming
    at revenue, reviewing yearly the turnover and setting a new higher target.

    Although this is a family run service, we pretend the highest standards from
    the shrub to the cup. That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each
    step of the coffee’s journey.

      The first time I tried Hosting for Jesus’s coffee, I couldn’t even believe
      that was the same thing I’ve been drinking every morning.
